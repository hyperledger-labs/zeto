First pioneered by the Bitcoin network, the UTXO state model uses individual tokens similar to coins to represent states.

Each UTXO defines its own spending rules that must be satisfied in order to spend.</p> Commitment <p>Every UTXO state maintained by the Zeto smart contract is a representation of the secrets (value, ownership) behind the token. The form of representation is a secure cryptographic hash of the secrets. This is formally called a commitment because it \"locks down\" the secrets. Any attempts to change the secrets such as the value or the ownership of a token will result in a different hash. These commitments are critical in verifying ZKPs to process transactions.</p> Nullifier <p>It's a special type of hash that is securely, and secretly, bound to an UTXO. It's sole purpose is to demonstrate that a UTXO has been spent, although which particular UTXO is known only to the owner. Only the owner of an UTXO can produce the proper nullifier for the UTXO, which can be proven with a ZKP. Nullifiers are used when history masking is required, so that no one other than the owner of a UTXO can find out which UTXO have been spent by a transaction.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/basics/","title":"Basic Concepts","text":"<p>Zeto is built on the following fundamental concepts.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/basics/#onchain-state-model-utxo","title":"Onchain state model: UTXO","text":"<p>The smart contract for a token economy must maintain states onchain.

A transaction updates the states of one or more accounts.</li> <li>The UTXO model works very differently, by creating states that are independent to each other. Each UTXO state is in one of two modes: unspent or spent. A transaction consumes unspent states, at which point they become spent, and produces new (unspent) states. Each UTXO state specifies the spending rules that must be satisfied when a transaction attempts to spend it.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"concepts/basics/#utxo-for-better-parallel-processing","title":"UTXO for better parallel processing","text":"<p>The UTXO model is adopted for Zeto instead of the account model, for better support of parallel processing. Due to the necessity of maintaining private states offchain in order to achieve privacy, the client must continuously keep their private states in sync with the smart contract. Using an account model makes it more difficult to achieve this because incoming transfers from other parties would invalidate an account's state, making the account owner unable to spend from its account unless the private state has been sync'ed again. Solutions to this issue, often referred to as front-running, typically involve a spending window with a pending queue. One example of this is Zether, which describes an <code>epoch</code> construct with pending transaction queues to address the front-running problem. Using epochs results in limited parallel processing of transactions from the same spending account.</p> <p>With a UTXO model, on the other hand, since each state is independent of the others, spending multiple UTXOs at the same time, even if they call come from the same owner, can be easily achieved.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/basics/#utxo-for-better-anonymity","title":"UTXO for better anonymity","text":"<p>With an account model, given that the states are mapped to the owning accounts in the onchain storage, there is an inherent challenge to anonymity, where checking which account was updated by a transaction would reveal the counterparties of a transaction. This could be mitigated by using anonymity sets, where more accounts besides the real sender and receiver of a transaction are updated with an encrypted zero value. However this increases the gas cost of transactions.</p> <p>With the UTXO model, since each UTXO state describes its own ownership, in a masked form (<code>hash(value, owner public key, salt)</code>), there is no revelation of the owning account when a UTXO is spent or produced. Furthermore, the entitlement to spend the private UTXO token is demonstrated by the ZK proof, rather than the transaction signer (aka <code>msg.sender</code>). This allows Zeto transactions to be signed by any accounts.

The secrets are represented as private states: <code>s1, s2, s3</code></li> <li>How party A obtained the secrets for the owned tokens, is dependent on the specific Zeto implementation. It can be from offchain channels or from onchain (encrypted) data</li> <li>Party A sends transaction <code>Tx1</code> to transfer some value to party B. The transaction consumes 2 tokens <code>#1, #2</code> and produces 2 new tokens <code>#4, #5</code>. <code>#5</code> is the value to be transferred to party B. <code>#4</code> is the remainder value that goes back to party A</li> <li>Even though party A knows the secrets of <code>#5</code>, they won't be able to spend the token because party A is not the owner of the token.</li> <li>Ownership verification is enforced by the Zeto smart contract when it verifies the zero knowledge proofs. Each ZKP circuit ensures that the sender's private key is used as a private input signal to derive the public key, which is then hashed to calculate the commitments</li> <li>Party B sends transaction <code>Tx2</code> to transfer some value to party C.
