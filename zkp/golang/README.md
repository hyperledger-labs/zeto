# Confidential UTXO golang library

The project does NOT contain some of the cryptographic materials to perform proof generations and verifications, such as the proving keys and the verification keys. You must run the [build steps](/zkp/js/README.md#build) before you can run the tests.

> You do NOT need to re-compile the circuits. Start with the step to[Generate the proving key](/zkp/js/README.md#generate-the-proving-key).

Once the proving keys and verification keys are generated, set the following environment variables

- `CIRCUITS_ROOT`: the folder that contains the WASM runtime for the circuits that are generated by the circom compiler. If you do not want to compile the circtuis yourself, a copy of them are included in the `js/lib` folder
- `PROVING_KEYS_ROOT`: the folder that contains the proving keys and verification keys
