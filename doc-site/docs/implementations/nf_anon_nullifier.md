This implements a non-fungible token using nullifiers, thus hiding the spending graph.

The statements in the proof include:

- the output UTXO hashes are based on the same id, uri as the input UTXO hashes
- the sender possesses the private BabyJubjub key, whose public key is part of the pre-image of the input commitment hashes, which match the corresponding nullifiers
- the nullifiers represent input commitments that are included in a Sparse Merkle Tree represented by the root hash
